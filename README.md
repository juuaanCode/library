[![es](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-es-red.svg)](/README-ES.md)

This project is part of the subject _Interacción Persona Computadora_ (Human-Computer Interaction) of Computer Science at University of Valladolid.
It was a way to learn how to create applications using de MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and was developed using Java in collaboration with Alejandro Miñambres, another student.

The application aims to be a tool to register books in a library and allows each user to keep track of which ones have been already read.
It features 3 different windows:

* A welcome screen with different statistics of the library, like the average price of the books or how many have been read. ![Welcome Screen](/img_welcomescreen.png)
* A window to edit several parameters of each book. Some edits are not allowed, like changing the universal identifier (ISBN). ![Edit Screen](/img_edit.png)
* A search window, which shows all the books in the library in a list. It allows to filter by searching in one of three different attributes and can load and save the library to an external file like [sample.txt](/sample.txt). ![Search Screen](/img_search.png)

The code and documentation (Javadoc) are written in Spanish.
